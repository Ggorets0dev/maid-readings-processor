## Installation

---
Two starting options are provided:

* Download the source code using an archive or git clone, then install dependencies, **run through Python 3.**

* Download the installer from the Releases page. Run it and then use the executable file. **Does not require Python 3.** *(Coming later)*

> **Note:** Running the immediate source code gives you the ability to open releases that have not been created as executable. Checks are performed each time before the release executable is loaded, but dynamically loaded libraries may not work correctly.
